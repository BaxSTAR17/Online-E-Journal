<!-- #               CCS DEVOTION>
The College of Computer Studies Devotion is one of the first events held during the Hibalag season for the CCS freshmen students. It was held on August 22, 2023, 8:00 PM at the ATA Hall organized by the Confederates Student Council. This event helps gather CCS freshmen students from different courses and unite in worship and song while listening to the wonderful sharing of our guest speaker for the devotion. I was very fortunate enough to be a part of the technical community and was able to help organize the event and its technical aspects that were essential.

I expected for our guest speaker to be able to share to us her experiences and her thoughtful advices that she could give to us students in the College of Computer Studies and I am very glad my expectations of these were met. The activity surprised me when there was apparantly free food after the devotion which was very convenient at the time because it was at the morning. The best part of the event is how I got to be behind the scenes and got to help with the technical difficulties of the event.

The event gave me insights from our speaker as well as learnings but since this was my first event as a member of the technical committee, I was also able to learn more about my duties and my responsibilities for not just events like the devotion but other essential ones especially during the Hibalag season. These learnings can be applied to my future as I might need these learnings to further go to my goal.

Because of this event, I am able to help organize and experience a proper devotion with my fellow CCS batchmates
