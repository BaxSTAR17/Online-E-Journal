<!-- #               CONFEDERATES COLLABORATIVE EVENT>
The Confederates Collaborative Event is an activity held for CCS students to help manage and prepare for the Parada. The event was held at any time within the day of August 27, 2023 at the UCS Lobby. It welcomes all CCS students alike and welcomes them so that the aesthetics committee can have more manpower and so that we would be able to get the job done faster in no time. As a dancer in the parada, on the break of my practice, I was able to help and extend service to my fellow collegemates and the aesthetic committee so that their workload can be decreased.

I genuinely enjoyed and liked this activity because it promotes unity and cooperation with one another until the teamwork is enough to get the task done. We were all doing our little tasks but these small tasks can offer a big help especially in a setting with a lot of manpower. The best parts of the event is definitely talking and still having fun with one another while working and listening to music while it motivates us to work more.

The event motivated us in a way that it pushes us to be closer and connected to each other. I got to strengthen a lot of my bonds that day which made me like the event even more and it even showed me the importance of friends and having someone to help you in your doings. This event may be tiring but we were able to leave the event with the thought that we can rely on each other healthily and thats a great benefit.

Because of this event, I am more open and cooperative for my fellow batchmates and college mates because this event taught me the importance of camaraderie and teamwork.

<!-- #               COMMUNITY MURAL>
The Community Mural is a community event held by DAKILA and Active Vista on September 29, 2023 near the Eleven Monkeys Store wherein any people from all accross dumaguete are able to contribute to this community mural so that we can have a unified and symbolistic community mural filled with concepts and ideas sprung from the people's mind and experiences. This event was made by and for the community, and as part of the community in Dumaguete City, myself, I decided to go to the mural and see what it has to offer.

The community mural exceeded my expectations as it was bursting with symbolical messages and was painted with great skill and effort and I really have to praise the community for making such a wonderful mural. Even though the mural is very small and it's not that noticable, the creativity and the concepts portrayed in the mural are crucially important and beautiful.

This community event influenced me to express myself more publicly whether it be for my opinions, for my perspectives or for my stands and beliefs, I would still want to practice expressing myself with the help of this event. A lot of the mini portions of the mural can actually teach and give important messages and learnings, and through this we can apply these in our lives and get reminded of it whenever we pass by the mural and for me, that is an important advantage and benefit.

Because of this event, I feel a lot happy knowing that there are a lot of people that are creative but are also willing to stand up for what they think is right.
